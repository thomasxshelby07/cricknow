# Admin Panel UX & Workflow Strategy (Locked)

> **Status:** PHASE 5 - LOCKED
> **Purpose:** To define the Admin Panel as the "SEO Operating System" of the platform.

---

## 1. Core Philosophy
*   **The Brain:** The Admin Panel decides *everything*. The frontend is a passive display.
*   **SEO OS:** It's not just for writing text; it's for managing the site's relationship with search engines.
*   **UX Pattern:** Consistency is king. All distinct content types (Sites, Blogs, News) share the **same** editing flow.

---

## 2. Global Layout Structure
A standard, professional dashboard layout.

*   **Left Sidebar:** Navigation modules (Collapsible).
*   **Top Bar:** User Profile, Role Badge (`SUPER ADMIN`), Logout, Global Search.
*   **Main Content:** The workspace.

### Sidebar Navigation Tree
```

  └─ Create Offer

System             (Protected: SUPER_ADMIN Only)
  ├─ Admins
  ├─ Audit Logs
  └─ Settings
```

---

## 3. The Dashboard (Command Center)
Not just a welcome screen. It must show **Actionable SEO Intelligence**.
*   **Key Metrics:** Total Published Pages, Drafts, Total Sites.
*   **SEO Health:** "3 Pages missing Meta Description", "1 Page with Duplicate Slug".
*   **Visibility Snapshot:** "Currently Showing on Home Hero: [Betway], [Parimatch]".

---

## 4. The "Tabbed" Editing Experience
**Critical Requirement:** To avoid scrolling fatigue and cognitive overload, all "Add/Edit" screens use a **6-Tab System**.

### Tab 1: 📝 Basic
*   **Focus:** The absolute minimum to create a record.
*   **Fields:** Title/Name, Slug, Category/Type, Core Content (Rich Text).

### Tab 2: 🔍 SEO (The Engine)
*   **Focus:** Search Engine instructions.
*   **Fields:**
    *   Meta Title (Character counter: 0/60)
    *   Meta Description (Character counter: 0/160)
    *   Focus Keywords (Tags)
    *   Canonical URL (Optional override)
    *   Robots Toggle: `Index/No-Index`, `Follow/No-Follow`.

### Tab 3: 🖼️ Media
*   **Focus:** Visual Assets.
*   **Fields:** Logo/Cover Image, OG Image (Social Share), Alt Text inputs.

### Tab 4: 👁️ Visibility (The Controller)
*   **Focus:** Where does this appear?
*   **Toggles:**
    *   `Show on Home`
    *   `Show on Category Page`
    *   `Is Featured?`
    *   `Display Order` (Number input for ranking).

### Tab 5: 🔗 Linking (The Spiderweb)
*   **Focus:** Internal Link Building.
*   **UI:** Multi-select dropdowns with search.
    *   "Related Betting Sites"
    *   "Related Blogs"
    *   "Related Offers"

### Tab 6: ⚙️ Status & Publish
*   **Focus:** Safety & Lifecycle.
*   **Fields:**
    *   Status: `Draft` | `Published` | `Hidden` | `Archived`
    *   Date Picker: "Publish Date" (Future scheduling possible)
    *   **Action Buttons:** `Save Draft`, `Preview`, `Publish Live`.

## 5. UX Safety & Warnings
The UI must actively prevent SEO suicide.

1.  **Slug Protection:** If editing an existing slug, pop up a "Danger" modal warning about broken links.
2.  **Completeness Checks:** If "Meta Description" is empty when hitting publish, show a warning toast (but allow proceed if user insists).
3.  **Visual Cues:**
    *   🟢 Published (Green Badge)
    *   🟡 Draft (Yellow Badge)
    *   🔴 No-Index (Red Tag next to title)

---

## 6. Role-Based UI (RBAC)
*   **Admin View:** Clean, focused on content. "System" section is invisible. "Delete" buttons for high-value assets are disabled or hidden.
*   **Super Admin View:** Full control, including "Hard Delete" and User Management.
